# Backlog Management (When Requested)

Create BACKLOG.md with:

- BACKLOG.md file in the root of the project
- Clear epic/activity structure
- Verbose descriptions for other developers/LLMs
- Step-by-step items with checkboxes
- Usage instructions at the top

## Template

This is the standard template to use when creating a BACKLOG.md file:

```text
# BACKLOG

## How to Use This Backlog

For each backlog item:

1. **Understand**: Read the item description and understand the scope
2. **Study**: Study the current state of the project that is related to the item
3. **Reason**: Reason about the best way to implement the item following the existing rules and without breaking anything
4. **Plan**: Make the list of the steps to implement correctly the item
5. **Execute**: Implement the changes step by step following the plan and the rules
6. **Test**: Run existing tests and add new ones if needed
7. **Validate**: Ensure the change works as expected and doesn't break anything
8. **Check**: Mark the item as completed `[x]` and move to the next

Work through items **in order** as later items depend on earlier foundational changes.
